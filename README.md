## Instructions
The files provided in Udacity's starter kit have been updated to create the arcade game. 

A player must win a level by reaching the water without getting hit by a bug. 

Each time they do this they will win the level and progress to the next level where the complexity of the game increases. 

The player starts the game with 3 lives, but each time the player collides with a bug their lives are reduced until they are out of the game. 

Clicking on the 'reset' button starts the game over.

## Getting started
Download the repository and load the index.html in your browser. 

## Notes
This project was created as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, which was awarded through a Google Developer Scholarship. 

This arcade game was developed to meet the requirements of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric). This module focuses on writing functions that are **object-oriented** â€“ either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions. Requirements also include using the keyword 'this' appropriately within a class and and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Further functionality and styling may be added and the README will be updated accordingly.
